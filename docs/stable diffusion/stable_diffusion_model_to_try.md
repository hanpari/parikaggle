With over 7000 models for Stable Diffusion published on various platforms and websites, choosing the right model for your needs is not easy. Moreover, many of these Stable Diffusion models are trained on specific styles or mediums rather than being general-use models.

But now, some Stable Diffusion checkpoints are loved and used widely by users and are considered the best. In this article, I’ll share the best Stable Diffusion models you should try out to generate beautiful images, and how to download them. Read further to understand why users generate over 2 million images on Stable Diffusion daily. These checkpoint models are of a wide variety and can help you generate realistic images, anime or illustration pictures, etc.

So, let’s get into it.

## The Best Stable Diffusion Checkpoint Models

When it comes to checkpoint models, there isn’t a one-size-fits-all solution. Different types of images and styles require different checkpoint models. With extensive testing, I’ve compiled this Stable Diffusion Models list of the best checkpoint models for Stable Diffusion to cater to various image styles and categories.

| Stable Diffusion Model | Best For                                           | Downloads            |

## Stable Diffusion Models By Type and Formats

Looking at the best stable diffusion models, you will come across a range of types and formats of models to use apart from the “checkpoint models” we have listed above. Here are all the types and formats you should know about:

### Stable Diffusion Models By Type

- **Checkpoint models**: Complete, Stable Diffusion models that can generate images independently. They contain all necessary weights and are typically large (2-7GB). These serve as the base for image generation.
- **Textual inversions**: Also known as embeddings, these are small files (10-100KB) that define new concepts or styles using text. They must be used in conjunction with a checkpoint model to modify generated images.
- **LoRA models**: LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) models are small (10-200MB) add-ons that fine-tune checkpoint models for specific styles or subjects. They offer efficient customization without requiring a full model retrain.
- **Hypernetworks**: Additional neural network modules (5-300MB) that modify the behavior of checkpoint models. They can add new styles or features to generated images when used with a base model.

### Stable Diffusion Model Formats

- **Pruned**: Models with unnecessary weights removed, resulting in smaller file sizes. They’re optimized for inference but can’t be used for further training.
- **Full**: Models containing all weights, including those used during training. They’re larger but allow for further fine-tuning or training.
- **EMA-only**: EMA (Exponential Moving Average) models contain only the averaged weights from training. They’re typically used for inference and are smaller than full models.
- **FP16**: Models using half-precision (16-bit) floating-point numbers, reducing file size and memory usage at a slight cost to precision.
- **FP32**: Models using full-precision (32-bit) floating-point numbers, offering maximum precision but with larger file sizes and higher memory requirements.
- **.pt**: PyTorch’s native file format. It’s widely used but can potentially contain malicious code from an untrusted source.
- **.safetensor**: A newer, security-focused format that prevents the execution of arbitrary code, making it safer to use models from various sources.

The best format depends on your specific needs:
- For general use, pruned FP16 safe-tensor models offer a good balance of size, speed, and safety.
- For further training or maximum precision, full FP32 models are preferred.
- For security, especially when using models from unknown sources, a safe-tensor format is recommended over .pt.

## 1. SDXL

- **Stable Diffusion Model Type**: Checkpoint trained
- **Published In**: 2023
- **Base Model**: SDXL 1.0
- **Download Link**: [Here](#)

The first and my favorite Stable Diffusion model is SDXL which is the official Stable Diffusion XL model released by Stability AI. This model is trained on 1024×1024 images thereby producing images of extreme detail and quality. The model is pretty good at realism but can also generate a wide variety of styles. In fact, I shared more than 80 Stable Diffusion styles that can be generated with this model.

The SDXL model comes in two models: the base model and the refiner model. For this, you might have to load the two models in Automatic1111 separately or in ComfyUI. Overall, SDXL can be your go-to model as it’s an all-rounder that can generate pretty much everything. However, it’s important to note that the model cannot generate legible text and isn’t well-trained for NSFW image generation. Still, it’s among my favorite SDXL models for generating extremely high-quality and detailed images.

**Key Features**:
- Supports a wide range of styles
- Perfect for realistic images
- Cannot generate legible text
- Works only with SDXL LoRA

## 2. Realistic Vision

- **Stable Diffusion Model Type**: Checkpoint Merge
- **Published In**: 2024
- **Base Model**: SD 1.5 Hyper
- **Download Link**: [Here](#)

Realistic Vision is the best stable diffusion model for photorealism and generates realistic human faces and portraits. It’s so good at generating faces and eyes that it’s often hard to tell if the image is AI-generated. The model is updated quite regularly and many improvements have been made since its launch.

Apart from photo-realistic human faces, you can also use this model to generate images of animals, objects, and landscapes. However, don’t expect this model to generate any fantasy environments or images, as it’s trained on real-life objects and images. Another thing I love about this model is that it nails the clothes and their details every single time. The clothes it generates are highly detailed and very realistic.

If you want to generate photorealistic human portraits in Stable Diffusion, this is one of the best models out there. There’s also an inpainting version available which is just as good as the main checkpoint model.

**Key Features**:
- Perfect for generating realistic humans
- Can generate objects, animals, and landscapes
- Supports NSFW image generation
- Inpainting version available
